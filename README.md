# xspi-8s-crc-retransmission-wk2532
This repository contains Verilog code for a JEDEC JESD251C compliant xSPI controller and slave. It features high-speed (400 MB/s) transfers, dual protocol modes (1S-1S-1S and 8D-8D-8D), and robust CRC8 error checking with retransmission logic. A comprehensive testbench has been developed to verify all functionality.
